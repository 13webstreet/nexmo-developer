# ...Building block name...

<!--
HOWTO: write a building block.

* Lay out each of the steps as subheadings.

* Use a table for key/value mappings (for request headings, JSON dicts, etc.)

* Prefer the use of the Nexmo client libraries over implementing your own.

* Extraneous detail that is not of general applicability should not be placed
  in a building block article but stored in a guide, and potentially fleshed
  out in a tutorial.
