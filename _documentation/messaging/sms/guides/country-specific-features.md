# Country specific features

Countries have different technical standards and restrictions around the SMS standard. Nexmo sends the message you give us to the phone number you designate cheaply and efficiently.

Before you start your messaging campaign you need to plan if the following features are supported in the countries and locations you are sending messages to:

- [Delivery Receipts](./delivery-reciepts)
- Support for [Alphanumeric Sender IDs](./custom-sender-id) and whether they have to be pre-registered
- [Encoding](./encoding)
- [Concatenation](./concatenation)
