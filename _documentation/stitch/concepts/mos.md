# Measuring Voice Or Video Quality

The overall quality of a voice or video stream is often depicted through a measure called [*Mean Opinion Score (MOS)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score).

It is common that MOS is represented as a rational number between 1 and 5, with the following scale: 
> 5 - Excellent, 4 - Good, 3 - Fair, 2 - Poor, 1 - Bad.

Frequently, MOS higher than 4 reflects a satisfying quality. For MOS higher than 4.3, the human senses cannot usually perceive an increase in quality. On the lower side, when MOS is lower than 3.5, commonly the quality isnâ€™t sufficient, especially for communication purposes.


### How is MOS calculated?
The MOS is calculated using an agreed upon formula, which utilizes multiple features of the steam passed over the network. Among those features are: jitter, packet loss, latency and network state.

In the past, a group of individuals was subjectively rating the quality of the experience. An arithmetic mean was calculated and gave a final score which represented the quality score. Later on, these scores were the base for the MOS formula, which now provides an objective score, which mostly represents the network quality.
