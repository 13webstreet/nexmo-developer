# Measuring Voice Or Video Quality

Measuring the quality of a voice or a video, is often done by a measurement called [*Mean Opinion Score (MOS)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score).
It is common that a MOS is represented as a rational number between 1 and 5, with the following scale: 
> 5 - Excellent, 4 - Good, 3 - Fair, 2 - Poor, 1 - Bad.

Frequently, a MOS higher than 4 reflects a satisfying quality. For MOS higher than 4.3, the human senses will usually won’t perceive an increase in quality. On the lower side, when MOS is lower than 3.5, commonly the quality isn’t sufficient, especially for the use case of communication purposes. 


### How is MOS calculated?
The MOS is calculated by agreed upon formula, with multiple variables which represent some features of the traffic passed on the network. Among these features are jitter, packet loss, latency and network state.
In the past, a group of individuals was subjectively rating the quality of the experience. An arithmetic mean was calculated and gave a final score which represented the quality score. Later on, these scores were the base for the MOS formula, which now provides an objective score, which mostly represents the network quality. 

What can you use MOS for?
Among usages: indicating to the user if the potential quality is sufficient for the communication, suggesting to switch a network or monitoring the statistics of your users to understand their needs.
