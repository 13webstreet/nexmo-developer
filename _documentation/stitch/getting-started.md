## Getting Started

To start with you'll need a [Nexmo Account](/account/guides/management#create-and-configure-a-nexmo-account), an [Application](/concepts/guides/applications) and the  private key provided when you created the application. Follow the prerequisites if you've not got an Application already.

| ### Prerequisites
|
| #### Install the Nexmo CLI
|
| * Ensure you have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed
| * Create a free Nexmo account - [signup](https://dashboard.nexmo.com)
| * Install the Nexmo CLI:
|
|    ```bash
|    $ npm install -g nexmo-cli@beta
|    ```
|
|    Setup the CLI to use your Nexmo API Key and API Secret. You can get these from the [setting page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) in the Nexmo Dashboard.
|
|    ```bash
|    $ nexmo setup api_key api_secret
|    ```
|
| #### Create an Application
|
| Create an application named `My first Conversation Application` and store the returned private key as `private.key` within your current working directory.
|
| ```sh
| $ nexmo app:create "My first Conversation Application" --type=rtc --keyfile=private.key
| ```
|
|
| #### Generate a JWT
|
| With a private key you can generate a JWT with the [Nexmo CLI](/tools):
|
| ```sh
| $ nexmo jwt:generate ./private.key
| ```
