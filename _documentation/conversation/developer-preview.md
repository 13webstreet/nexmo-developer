## About the Conversation API

The Nexmo Conversation API enables you to build conversation features where communication can take place across multiple mediums including IP Messaging, PSTN Voice, SMS and WebRTC Audio and Video.

Currently the Conversation API offers basic IP messaging with the following features:

* Conversation creation and management
* Sending and receiving text
* Member invite management
* Cache support
* Typing indicators
* Message sent, delivered and read receipts

Upcoming features will include:

* Image support
* Push notifications
* Voice support
